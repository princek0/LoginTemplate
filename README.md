# LoginTemplate
A website login template made with HTML, CSS, and JS. <br>
- Please note that the javascript authentication logic is not secure and should NOT be used in real practice. It is simply there for development purposes.
- I made this small project as a beginner in web development and so the code probably isn't good.
- The username and password is "Test" and "Test". Once logged in, the title should rename but you won't be redircted.
